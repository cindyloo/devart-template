## Flat New World
or The Land of the H(ij)acked Self

## Cindy Sherman Bishop, @cindyloo

## Description
Mark-making and story-telling are innate human traits.  This interactive installation/app examines portrait-making by compositing a cartoon-feed (perhaps stop-motion/frame extraction] over the "h(ij)acked" live video stream.  Participants can author additional images and/or text bubbles to augment the feed (via app touch or oF hand-tracking). As such, it examines the proliferation and consumption of the modern day digital "portrait."

As an artist, I have sketched and painted all my life.  With the advent of the digital selfie, I find this digital portraiture very curious. Are selfies portraits or are they more like caricatures?  If portraiture may be defined as a captured moment in time embeding an emotional quality then yes... I think?  How about our ever-growing video library? Where is the creative process now that we do not require painterly expertise, a skilled hand, nor expensive photography equipment?   Furthermore, how are these images interpreted and consumed by others?

As a software developer, I will reverse-engineer the digital image-making process.  I want to deconstruct digital video via opencv and go backwards into the nexus of portraiture, promoting the tenderness of a line, the emotional connection to a moment in time.  I am curious to see this composited live video, broken down frame-by-frame, and reconstructed not as a carbon-copy of the present moment but more of an artistic interpretation.  Can I leverage video's reflexive nature in a commentary about the origin and rise of the selfie? Will this result in merely another avatar or something more meaningful? The installation will capture these individual narratives and compose them into an ongoing mashup movie, a mediated video stream that is more than your average 'selfie' feed, as our data and online identities are more than just fodder for rabid consumption.
