## Description
Mark-making and story-telling are innate human traits.  This interactive installation/app illuminates these traits with a cartoon-feed (perhaps stop-motion/frame extraction] of a "h(ij)acked" live video stream.  Participants can draw additional images to augment the feed (via app touch or oF hand-tracking). As such, it examines the proliferation and consumption of the modern day digital "portrait."

As an artist, I have sketched and painted all my life.  With the advent of the digital selfie, I find this digital portraiture very curious. Are selfies portraits or are they more like caricatures?  If portraiture may be defined as a captured moment in time embeding an emotional quality then yes... I think?  How about our ever-growing video library? Where is the creative process now that we do not require painterly expertise, a skilled hand, nor expensive photography equipment?   Furthermore, how are these images interpreted and consumed by others?

As a software developer, I want to reverse-engineer this new digital image-making process.  I want to deconstruct digital video and go backwards to the nexus of portraiture, the tenderness of a line, the emotional connection.  I am curious to see what happens when I "hack" the digital image, frame-by-frame, and reconstruct not a carbon-copy of the present moment but more of an artistic interpretation?  Can I leverage video's reflexive nature in a commentary about the proliferation of the selfie? Will my result merely an animated avatar of the onlooker or something more meaningful? I wish to capture these individual narratives and compose them into an ongoing kind of movie, a mediated video stream that is more than what it appears, as our data and online identities are more than just fodder for corporate consumption.
