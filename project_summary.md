## Description
Mark-making and story-telling are innate human traits.  This interactive installation/app illuminates these traits with a cartoon-feed (perhaps stop-motion/frame extraction] of their live video stream.  As such, it examines the proliferation of the modern day digital "portrait."

Before digital images, creating a portrait required a level of skill. The creative process involving painterly expertise, 
a skilled hand, some expensive photography equipment. Such images captured a moment in time and often an emotional narrative.  Digital images
have arguably rendered this process unnecessary for many.
What happens when we deconstruct the moving digital image, frame-by-frame, rendering the image less of a carbon-copy of 
the present moment and more of an artistic nature. Is the result merely an animated avatar or something more meaningful? What kind of portraits and narratives are then created?  If we capture these individual narratives, what does the mashup of these portraits look like? Do we say more about ourselves with less?
