Please go to my github oF repository for the comic strip selfie oF code.  
Download and run the ofDebugApp.exe in the bin directory.

here in this rep is my nascent node.js code.  You won't be able to run it unless you set up CouchDb and node.js 
and I am not fetching images with ofxJSON yet anyway.  YOu should be able to get a good idea of the
Comic Strip Selfie installation aka Flat New World and possible mobile application from playing with the 
oF app or watching the movie attached in the project posts....


Can't wait to get this fully going.  WIsh I didn't have a day job! ;)
