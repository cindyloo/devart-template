for ease of documentation, the comic strip feed is combined into the same window as the video feed.
In installation-land, each feed would have its own (large) screen (see cover photo).

the comic strip stutters on purpose - I am repainting the video every 2 seconds.  The original Mickey Mouse and Popeye had a kind of jitter that I am trying to reproduce....

I am currently typing into the text balloon.  TO DO:  enable the user to move the box around the view, and to change the box to various and well-known comic strip balloons [the comment, the whisper, the gasp, the VO, etc]

I delved into node-opencv only to get a lazy symbol binding error.  I thought it might make sense
to just code everything in javascript, but as it is now, I'm going to just send it via http/ofxJSON.
the node.js and couchdb document and views are rolling fine though.
