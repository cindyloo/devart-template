researching edge detection algorithms.  I'm familiar with Canny and Sobel/Prewitt, not sure what combination
will result in my desired form....

I took a Coursera course this summer- it was really challenging wrapping my head around the Maths
"Coding The Matrix: Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Application".  Weekly course assignments
learning Python AND discrete mathematics proved too much for a contiguous 8 weeks during my summer break,
but I really learned a huge amount.  Understanding dot- and cross-matrix calculations is a pre-requisite for hacking
digital images/video... I like to call it the maths the May-tricksies...
