well, that was a drag-  I had bought a refurbished macbook pro late 2011 and the HD crashed.  Still
under warranty so I've got a brand new HD and logic board.  

The good think is that while I haven't been doing a whole lot of coding for THIS project, I have
been thinking about it....  Echoes in particular.  Echoes of people, caricatures of what was once
right in front of us.

Various comic strips will fade in and out.  The text is hooked up to the individuals Twitter feed- if
they choose to do so.  Otherwise, the thought bubble or text will use random Twitter feeds (I think).

More later!
