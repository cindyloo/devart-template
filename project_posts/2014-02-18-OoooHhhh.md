so, I had this thought...

what if the caricature could pull up similar images per the google custom search api?  you see an audience of doppelgangers....  They are all watching you watching them... the infinite selfie recursion...

what if I used the Kyle's face tracker to match the orientation of the faces - could it be fast enough to 
have the google images faces "turn" as our participant's face turns?  I know arturo did something related - he mapped
Paris Hilton's face onto his...

I just grabbed a Google API key and instantiated a CSE.  Will do a quick prototype and see how responsive the api is, then see how I could filter the faces...The only thing about faceTracker is it doesn't do great with profiles or bad lighting...

I made a Smiley Face app a couple years ago that mimicked the users expression.  It did a lot of fakey-mc-fake-fake interpretation due to various issues.
